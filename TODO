Phase 1
-------
-Create a physics object with a letter associated
-Place the object in space
-<Framerate> times a second, update the position of the object based on velocity, gravity, and position
-When the object hits the "floor", stop manually

Phase 2
-------
-Impulse resolution
-Make the "floor" an object with infinite mass
